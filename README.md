# JuliaCon Example Programs

Here is the source for the examples used for the [SFML.jl] (https://github.com/zyedidia/SFML.jl) talk at JuliaCon 2015.

Dependencies for the programs:

* spinning image: SFML
* double pendulum: SFML, [AnimatedPlots] (https://github.com/zyedidia/AnimatedPlots.jl)
* [SpaceShooter] (https://github.com/zyedidia/SpaceShooter.jl): SFML
* sound recorder: SFML
* pyramid topple: SFML, [Chipmunk] (https://github.com/zyedidia/Chipmunk.jl)
* shapes: SFML, Chipmunk
* logo smash: SFML, Chipmunk

There is also a bonus game. The "jump-game" was not shown at JuliaCon, but is included in this repository. (It's inspired from Doodle jump)
